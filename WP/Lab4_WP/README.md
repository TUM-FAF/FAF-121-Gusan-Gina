Laboratory Work Nr.4
====================
Title:
------
Windows Timer. Animation.
------------
Contents:

•	Windows timer

Completed Mandatory Objectives:
--------------------
•	Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

Objectives With Points:
----------------------
•	Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel (2 pt)

•	Solve flicking problem (2 pt)

•	Add animated objects which interact with each other (2-6 pt)

Basic features:
--------------------------
For this laboratory work, I used, as usual, information from [http://msdn.microsoft.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com) and [http://stackoverflow.com](http://http://stackoverflow.com) sites. I proposed myself to create an application that would generate a ball each time I click the mouse. The balls are moving with different velocities in different angles. After interaction, the speed of the two balls gets balanced. Initially, the balls are having different colors. Once the balls clash, their colors change depending on their position in our array. This means that the first one that will get green is the first one from my array and the ball that will keep its initial color until the rest get green, is the last one from my array.


Here is the screenshot of the application:

Conclusion:
-----------

In this laboratory work we had to build an application that would involve animations. Doing it helped me discover some new features of Windows Programming and apply them into my program. One of them was using timer, which I found really useful for the working process. I enjoyed doing this activity, because it developed my abilities and made me understand how to use double buffering for the flickering problem.
