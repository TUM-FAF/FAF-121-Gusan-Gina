# Laboratory Work Nr.3

### Title: GUI Development using Visual Studio

" It is 4102. Aliens invaded us. Luckily the world has some great engineers and you are one of them! Your'e working on an unbeatable weapon: Simulatron. Simulatron is an exact copy of alien ship but it has a secret: when the alien gets into ship the alien is traped and brought into human prison. Your task is very simple: you have to clone Simulatron's control panel. World depends on you..."

#### Completed Mandatory Objectives:

   - Define 3 virtual tasks that you Simulatron is supposed to control
   - Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls (any child window control mentioned in book Windows Programming ed.5 is considered standard)


#### Objectives with points:

   - Add 3 non-standard controls (2pt)   
   - Create a custom control (not existent in IDE) (2pt)
   - Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions (1pt) 
   - Create a _Reset_ button. On clicking this button all controls should go to their default state (1pt)
   - Set a breakpoint in your application and check variables values at that moment of time (1pt)
   - Create an installable application (1pt)


#### Features:
       
    For this laboratory work, I used Visual Studio IDE. I have created a _WindowsFormsApplication_ consisting of:
    
        - A Picture Box, used for displaying images (in our case - the enemies)
        - A Stopwatch, used for counting the remaining time 
        - Three button controls
        - Two informal labels used for counting the number of detected and destroyed enemies
        - Another informal label, that displays the status of our control panel (found enemies or not)

    Also, I have utilized a synthesizer and dialog boxes in my program in order to share messages with potential users, depending on the possible simulations.

#### Conclusion:
 
 I found very interesting this laboratory work because of several reasons. One of them is that I really enjoy creating user interfaces with Visual Studio. Drag and drop-ing is awesome. Also, it provides a various toolbox and assures working with different features like sound effects and images. Once you get the idea of such kind of applications, it becomes a pleasure to make them.
