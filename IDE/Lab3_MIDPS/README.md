Laboratory Work Nr.3
====================
Title:
------
Mobile Applications Development
------------
Prerequisites:

•   IDEs: (one of) Visual Studio, Xcode, Android Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans

•   Languages: C#, JavaScript, Objective C, Java

•	Technologies and Frameworks: Windows Mobile, iOS, Android

Completed Mandatory Objectives:
--------------------
•	Study design guidlines for any mobile OS (Android, iOS, Windows Mobile)

•	Create a mobile app and launch it on emulator/simulator. Your app should have at least 3 element (ex. button, textarea, statusbar...) and 	one action (ex. clicking on a button will trigger a popup)

Objectives With Points:
----------------------
•	Install your application on a mobile phone. It should have somewhere your full name (on main screen, in settings...) (2pt)

•	Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)

•	Use a hardware device for testing and debugging (1pt)

Features:
--------------------------
For this laboratory work, I have decided to work with Android applications. I've built a simple calculator, that would provide executing the standard operations: '+' '-' '*' '/'. The calculator allows computations with float numbers.

Conclusion:
-----------

This laboratory work helped me remeber some features of Android apps and learn some new ones. It is not the first time when I work with Eclipse, so I have managed to finish my program in a resonable time. I didn't create my design by drag-and-drop-ing because I wanted to try and work with relative layouts.
