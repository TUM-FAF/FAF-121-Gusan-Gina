#### Conclusion:
 
 This laboratory work helped me to get some basic knowledge about Ruby on Rails. It was quite unusual for me, because I've never done something like this. I found very useful the tutorials from the official site. Practically, thanks to them I was able to finish my Rails application. I used _Sublime Text_ as text editor because it is my favorite since I've discovered it.
